class.info - contains description of selected feature points

class.sym.inf - contains correspondences (all corresponding points
are on the same line, there is single entry for feature points, indices
as in class.info file).

meshID.vts - contains vertex ids (1 vertex per line) of manually selected feature points (each line here corresponds to a line in class.info)
